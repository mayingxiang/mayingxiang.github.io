I've had the privilege of teaching as a lecturer for the [**Biomedical and Computational Discovery Experience**](http://biocodevu.com/) at Vanderbilt's Center for AI in Protein Dynamics, where I guided students through computational languages and biophysics.

I also served as a teaching assistant at the Data Science Institute of two core courses:
- **Survey of Data Science Applications** - exploring real-world data secience applications across industries
- **Data Management Systems** - from SQL basics to advanced database design

## DEERTransformer: AI for Protein Spectroscopy
I'm developing a transformer-based approach to interpret DEER (Double Electron-Electron Resonance) spectroscopy data. This project bridges machine learning and structural biology, helping researchers better understand protein dynamics and conformational changes.

## Spatial Transcriptomics Analysis
Created a novel cell clustering method using autoencoders for spatially resolved transcriptomics data. The tool leverages spatial information to improve data quality and helps identify differentially expressed genes in tissue samples.

## Academic Email Assistant
During my Data Science for Social Good internship, I built a transformer model that helps international students write professional emails. The system performs style transfer to ensure messages are culturally appropriate and professionally toned.

## ML-Powered Investment Strategies
Led a team project applying machine learning to predict factor performance in financial markets. We developed conviction-weighted portfolios using probability scores from our models to optimize investment strategies.

## COVID-19 Prediction Modeling
Early in the pandemic, I worked with Professor Guohua Zou to develop regression models for predicting COVID-19 outbreak patterns, contributing to public health planning efforts in China.
